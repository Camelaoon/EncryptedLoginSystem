# EncryptedLoginSystem
This project has a custom encryption and decryption system in it so users can't modify or see users passwords.

This not simple project is here becouse i was trying to find an encrypted login system using a file database.
But I couldn't find one, so I made my own to put it on the internet so anyone else isn't going to have this problem again.
